Folder Scanner for Image Validation
Date: 27.07.2025

This script scans a folder for JPG images and validates them using PIL.
It's designed as a preprocessing step for depth estimation to filter out
invalid or corrupted images that could cause processing errors.

Purpose: Before running depth estimation models, it's crucial to identify
and exclude invalid images that might crash the processing pipeline.
This script creates a clean list of valid images for reliable batch processing.

Main features:
- Recursively scans folders for .jpg files
- Validates images using PIL to ensure they can be opened
- Uses multiprocessing for parallel validation
- Outputs a clean list of valid image paths
- Provides progress tracking and statistics
